The heart and soul of the project are the two proprietary python libraries developed from scratch â€“ "pathforger" and "voicemaster". Both of them feature a good deal of controlled randomness to ensure that the content is original.

The backend of the project was built as a monolith but organically evolved into a small web of microservices. Each of those is built with the FastAPI framework, as it is lightweight, really fast, and refreshingly convenient to work with.

The front-end is built with React and Typescript for responsive UI.
